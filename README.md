# Collaborative Text Editor

## Project Overview
The Collaborative Text Editor is a cloud-based application that enables real-time collaboration on text documents. This innovative solution is designed to facilitate seamless interaction and editing for multiple users, making it an ideal tool for professionals, students, and individuals who require efficient and collaborative document handling.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Collaboration**: Multiple users can simultaneously work on the same document, allowing for instant feedback and collaborative editing.
- **Web-Based Editing**: Accessible from anywhere with an internet connection, the editor's intuitive interface makes it easy to use, even for those with limited technical expertise.
- **Document Formatting**: Offers robust formatting capabilities including styles, fonts, colors, and layouts to give documents a professional look.
- **Seamless Sharing**: Users can generate links for easy document sharing and collaboration.
- **High Availability**: Ensures uninterrupted access to documents, enhancing productivity and user experience.
- **Persistent File Storage**: All edits and documents are stored securely in the cloud, accessible anytime via a unique link.

## Technologies Used
This project leverages various AWS services and technologies, including:
- **Frontend**: React.js, hosted on AWS EC2.
- **Backend**: Node.js functions running on AWS Lambda.
- **Storage**: AWS S3 for storing documents and Amazon DynamoDB for metadata.
- **Networking**: AWS API Gateway for handling API requests.
- **Security and Management**: AWS Secrets Manager and AWS Backup.

## User Base and Performance Targets
Targeted at professionals, students, and anyone in need of collaborative document editing, the project aims for low-latency editing, real-time synchronization, high availability, and reliable data storage.

## How It Works
- **Frontend Interaction**: The user accesses the text editor through a React.js-based frontend, which communicates with the backend via AWS API Gateway.
- **Backend Processing**: Node.js-based AWS Lambda functions handle file creation, retrieval, and email notifications.
- **Data Storage**: Documents are stored in AWS S3, with metadata managed in Amazon DynamoDB.
- **Security**: AWS Secrets Manager ensures secure storage of sensitive configuration data.

## Future Enhancements
Plans for future development include:
- Real-Time Editing and Version Control.
